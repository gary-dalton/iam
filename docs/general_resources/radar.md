# Radar and Ground Penetrating Radar

## Radar

Given the correct software, radar is an effective means of sensing the
environment. It is not subject to light conditions. Weather conditions will
affect imaging but these can be accounted for.

The biggest issue with radar is cost. Most systems will be prohibitive unless
the application is very demanding.

- [Tin Can Radar Forum](http://glcharvat.com/tincan/)

This is an excellent resource on radar and includes instructions for building a
lower cost radar system.

## Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR)

GPR is an excellent method to image near subsurface ground conditions. It is
also very cost prohibitive for most applications.
