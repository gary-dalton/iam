# Real Time Location Services (RTLS)

For a variety of reasons, I think that the best approach for our RTLS is using
Ultra Wideband (UWB). The location implementation by Decawave seems most
promising.

## Status

I have contacted Time Domain to determine the cost, requirements and
implementations of their products. Have not heard back yet.
