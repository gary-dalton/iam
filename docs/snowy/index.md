# IAM Snowy

## Concept

Intellamech has the purpose of creating intelligent autonomous mechatronics.
We intend to build robots with programmable intelligence such that the robot
will sense, plan, and act to reach its goals.

## Status

This project is in very early stage development. This means gathering data,
reviewing literature, testing hypotheses, and building early concept-test
prototypes. Once projects are clearly defined, separate repositories will be
created for each.
